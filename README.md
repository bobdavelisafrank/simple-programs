# simple-programs
Various small projects/programs done in various languages.

This is more or less a place for me to dump the things I've written while learning certain languages -- mostly consisting of small code that isn't up to any standard except whatever I held myself to at the time it was written. 

There's a few interesting things under the Haskell folder, like `symbolicmath.lhs`.

You'll note the lack of anything in C. This is because my early C code is now completely embarassing -- I had a look at it the other day, and I saw a function prototype declared in the middle of a function. I didn't know that was possible, and nowadays I don't even want to know that it is; thanks, old me.
