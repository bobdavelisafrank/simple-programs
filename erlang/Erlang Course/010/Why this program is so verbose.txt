This program is probably like 75 lines of actual code, with an added 150 for
documenting and logging progress throughout it.

To find out why, search the document for capitalized Z's, notice that where they
are puts them in the scope of an already define variable X, and understand that
I automatically had put X's where those Z's are.






This is why you make descriptive variable names. The 'X' should really have been
'Number_of_Slaves' instead...
